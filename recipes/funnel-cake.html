        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Funnel cake is a dessert that is popular at carivals, fairs, and amusement parks! It is essentially fried pancake batter with powdered sugar.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.</li>
            <li>Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.</li>
            <li>Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour in 1 cup of batter. Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the funnel in a swirling motion to make 6- or 7-inch round. Fry in hot oil until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue cooking remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.</li>
